# SFC Quick Start

This repo is intended to give devs the empty pieces they need to get a Skafos project up and running.

This repo contains:
- `metis.config.yml` - a config file detailing jobs, resource allocations and project tokens
- `startup.ipynb` - an empty notebook to run your code
- `requirements.txt` - a file listing your project's dependencies
